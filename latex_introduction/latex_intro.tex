\section*{A few potentially useful links and tips}

A few tips and links.

\begin{itemize}
\item You can use \LaTeX for any sort of document, from papers, to books, to presentations, resum√©'s, you name it. 
\item \LaTeX is highly flexible, if something is not defined yet (which is possible, although it's also likely that someone already has found a solution to your potential problem), you can program it yourself\footnote{I have never done this yet, but I hear it's possible.. ;-)}! :)
\item Just like with programming, duckduckgo\footnote{In case of no result you may want to resort to the tool from a company that already know way too much about you any way.} and stackoverflow are your friend!
\item to get started, find yourself a good cheat sheet! ({\it hint:} you may have found one already in a convenient location)
\item For collaborative research Overleaf is a great tool to write your paper. But you may find it also useful for yourself. It even has a lot of templates for different journal and direct submit options. See \url{www.overleaf.com}.
\item \LaTeX is open source, so there are many applications or editors to make your documents. I use {\large\bf\TeX Maker} but there's plenty of other options too for various platforms. See \url{https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors/} for a few ideas.
\item citations are hassle free using {\LARGE Bib\TeX}. You can use your favourite paper archive tool such as Mendeley or Citavi to export all your references to a Bib\TeX\ (.bib) file. '
\item Formulas were never as easy to insert and reference!
\item Don't be fooled, there's no such thing as free lunch, \LaTeX can be a pain in the behind at times... :(  But usually the result is great! 
\end{itemize}

Now let's get started! Go to \url{www.overleaf.com} sign in, click \emph{new project}\ :\ \emph{exmaple project} to get started and let's write some document together. You may find a few useful files  in this github folder.
